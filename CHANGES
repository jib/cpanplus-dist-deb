Changes for 0.XX
================================================
*   Remove several hardcoded Debian-specific assumptions, like
    '/usr/bin/perl'. (hdp)

Changes for 0.12        Fri May  8 12:35:57 2009
================================================
*   We were using an internal deprecated module from CPANPLUS 
    directly, which has been removed in the latest stable release.
    Since the module provided no needed functionality, the use
    statement has simple been removed.
    Users of CPANPLUS 0.85_01 and later should upgrade to this
    release.

Changes for 0.10        Fri Oct 19 15:26:42 2007
================================================
*   Promote 0.09_01 to stable.

Changes for 0.09_01     Fri Oct 19 15:09:44 2007
================================================
*   Make $dist->create adhere to the 'keep_source' option,
    if provided, as reminded by Andreas Marienborg. This
    means that cpan2dist --keepsource will now work as
    expected.

Changes for 0.08        Sat Jul  7 11:35:34 2007
================================================
*   Address #27562 (A way to specify external dependencies would be
    grand) by supporting the new metafile munge callback as supported 
    by CPANPLUS > 0.81.
*   Constify the DEB spec version

Changes for 0.06        Sun Jun 17 14:21:15 2007
================================================
*   Address #27558 - setting deb_version=2 does not promote 
    a rebuild of a package. --deb_version=X wasn't being
    passed around properly.
*   Fix file clean up regex    
*   Fix uninit variable warning
*   Package names with a '+' caused errors in deb-genchanges;
    substituted to '-'

Chnages for 0.05        Sun Aug 13 15:28:48 2006
================================================
*   small changes to make tests pass without warnings if
    there are no signature checking modules installed
*   Up CPANPLUS prerequisite to 0.061

Changes for 0.04        Wed Mar 15 16:09:03 2006
================================================
*   use Package::Constants to list constants
*   documentation improvements
*   add heuristics what versions of prereqs
    to depend on rather than just assuming
    CPAN most recent
*   Due to a bug in module::build we need to
    remove the .packlist from their installations
    (see rt bug #18162)
*   Make sure the first letter of the 'pool' dir
    is from the package name, not the module name


Changes for 0.03_01     Sun Oct 16 13:09:17 2005
================================================
*   First public beta  release of CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb
