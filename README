* Description

CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb

    CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb is a CPANPLUS plugin that allows you to 
    create debian packages from CPAN packages. This is as easy as
    passing an extra option to the installation process or setting
    a config option.

* Installation

CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required, but
it does have dependencies on external programs, which currently
require you to install the following packages:
    
       debhelper
       dpkg
       dpkg-dev
       fakeroot
       gcc
       libc6-dev

To use the (optional) automatic creation of Sources.gz and 
Packages.gz files, to use your locally created .debs as an 
apt repository you need the following packages:

        apt-utils

This module is probably most easily installed using the cpan2deb 
mirror found at 'debian.pkgs.cpan.org'. Add the following line to your
apt sources.list to use it:

    # debian.cpan
    deb http://debian.pkgs.cpan.org/debian unstable main
