=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb> is a distribution class to create C<debian>
packages from C<CPAN> modules, and all it's dependencies. This allows
you to have the most recent copies of C<CPAN> modules installed,
using your package manager of choice, but without having to wait for
central repositories to be updated.

You can either install them using the API provided in this package,
or manually via C<dpkg>.

Some of the bleading edge C<CPAN> modules have already been turned
into debian packages for you, and you can make use of them by adding
the following line to your C</etc/apt/sources.list> file:
    
    deb http://debian.pkgs.cpan.org/debian unstable main

Note that these packages are built automatically from CPAN and are 
assumed to have the same license as perl and come without support.
Please always refer to the original C<CPAN> package if you have 
questions.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item parent()

Returns the C<CPANPLUS::Module> object that parented this object.

=item status()

Returns the C<Object::Accessor> object that keeps the status for
this module.

Look at C<CPANPLUS::Dist> for a list of standard accessors every
C<Dist::*> object will have. Below is a list of those specific to
this package.

Note that these are mostly to ensure the inner workings of this
package.

=back

=head1 STATUS ACCESSORS

All accessors can be accessed as follows:
    $deb->status->ACCESSOR

=over 4

=item rules()

The location of the C<debian/rules> file. 

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item compat()

The location of the C<debian/compat> file

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item changelog()

The location of the C<debian/changelog> file

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item copyright()

The location of the C<debian/copyright> file

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item control()

The location of the C<debian/control> file

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item distdir()

The directory where the C<.deb> file is placed.

Will be removed after successful creation.

=item package()

The location of the C<.deb> file.

Note this is equivalent to the C<dist> accessor already
standardly provided.

=item files()

List of all the generated files for this distribution.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $bool = CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb->format_available();

Returns a boolean indicating whether or not you can use this package
to create and install modules in your environment.

It will verify if you have all the necessary components avialable to
build your own debian packages. You will need at least these 
dependencies installed:

=over 4

=item debhelper
    
=item dpkg

=item dpkg-dev
    
=item fakeroot

=item gcc

=item libc6-dev

=item findutils

    my $flag;
    for my $prog (qw[gencat dpkg dh_perl gcc cp dpkg-buildpackage

            error(loc("'%1' is a required program to build debian packages",
                      $prog));
            $flag++;
        }
    }
    return $flag ? 0 : 1;
}

=head2 $bool = $deb->init

Sets up the C<CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb> object for use.
Effectively creates all the needed status accessors.

Called automatically whenever you create a new C<CPANPLUS::Dist> 
object.

=head2 $loc = $dist->prepare([perl => '/path/to/perl', distdir => '/path/to/build/debs', copyright => 'copyright_text', prereq_target => TARGET, force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL, skiptest => BOOL, prefix => 'prefix-', distribution => 'disttype', deb_version => INT])

C<prepare> preps a distribution for creation. This means it will create
all meta data files required by C<dpkg-buildpackage> to build a C<.deb>
file of hte module you specified. 
This will also satisfy any prerequisites the module may have.

If you set C<skiptest> to true, it will skip the C<test> stage.
If you set C<force> to true, it will go over all the stages of the
creation process again, ignoring any previously cached results. It
will also ignore a bad return value from the C<test> stage and still
allow the operation to return true.

Returns true on success and false on failure.

You may then call C<< $deb->create >> on the object to create the 
C<.deb> from the metadata, and then C<< $deb->install >> on the object 
to actually install it.

Returns the location of the builddir on success, and false on failure.

Note any extra options you pass along, will be passed to the underlying
installers verbatim. This enables you to, for example, specify extra 
flags for the C<perl Makefile.PL> stage.

=item Scan for proper license

Right now we assume that the license of every module is C<the same
as perl itself>. Although correct in almost all cases, it should 
really be probed rather than assumed.
This forms a barrier before C<.debs> generated by this package can
be used by C<debian> itself in it's own repositories.

=item Long description

Right now we provided the description as given by the module in it's
meta data. However, not all modules provide this meta data and rather
than scanning the files in the package for it, we simply default to the
name of the module.

### XXX what is the use of:
### Build-Depends vs Build-Depends-Indep?
### According to HE:
### Put debhelper *always* in Build-Depends (not -Indep!). The rest goes to
### Build-Depends-Indep for non-xs packages, in the case something has to be
### compiled, put all dependencies into Build-Depends.

### Standards-Version
### <HE> About Standards-Version: The standards version defines which policy
#### revision was used to create this packages. In fact it's not important,
#### just put the newest one in there (3.6.1 at the moment)

### Source vs Package
### Package vs. Source: You can build more than one deb from a source package
### (which is a tarball with the upstream sources and a diff with the debian
### changes, don't worry about that, it'll be created automatically if you do
### the right stuff (which i'll ensure)). One of my packages' source package
### is called libgtk2-perl and created 2 debs: libgtk2-perl and
### libgtk2-perl-doc.

### Why is Version not mentioned in the example?
### <HE> You don't have to worry about these things, these fields are
### generated by dh_builddeb
### <HE> The version of a package is not controlled in debian/control, but in
### debian/changelog. The version of the first entry is used to say which
### version this is.
### <HE> As you create the changelog properly, everything should be OK.

# 11:22 <HE> I told ypu total crap
# 11:23 <HE> First rule:
# 11:23 <HE> Always add debhelper to Build-Depends.
# 11:23 <HE> Second rule:
# 11:24 <HE> If a package has no XS stuff (what i mean: No arch-dependent stuff)
#            put all dependencies (for building as well as for running) into
#            Build-Depends-Indep.
# 11:24 <HE> Third rule:
# 11:24 <HE> If a package *has* XS stuff (what i mean: No arch-dependent stuff)
#            put all dependencies (for building as well as for running) into
#            Build-Depends.
# 11:25 <HE> Fourth rule:
# 11:25 <HE> Put all Dependencies into Depends (+ the ${$FOO} stuff)
# 11:25 <HE> That should be everything you need.
# 11:26 <HE> You can do better, but you can't script that.
# 11:28 <kane> ehm, ok... stil lone point of confuseion.. when you say 'package
#              has xs stuff' do you mean a a dependency (like Has::XS) or the
#              module it self (A)?
# 11:30 <HE> The module itself.

# 11:32 <kane> ok, can you write just 2 rule sets out for me, completely? case 1:
# 11:33 <kane> module A::With::XS, has prereqs Pure::Perl and Has::XS and needs
#              Needed::To::Build to build
# 11:33 <kane> case 2, module B::No::XS, same prereqs and all
# 11:35 <HE> OK, for A::With::XS
# 11:35 <HE> Build-Depends: debhelper, libhas-xs-perl, libneeded-to-build-perl
# 11:35 <HE> Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libhas-xs-perl
# 11:36 <HE> For B::No::XS:
# 11:36 <HE> Build-Depends: debhelper
# 11:36 <HE> Build-Depends-Indep: libhas-xs-perl, libneeded-to-build-perl
# 11:36 <HE> Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libhas-xs-perl
# 11:37 <HE> Oh. I've forgotten Pure::Perl, but it always has to be next to
#            libhas-xs-perl. There's no difference between the two.
# 11:37 <kane> okidoki... what's the ${} stuff in the Depends line?
# 11:39 <HE> They are substvars. They are filled by debhelper. (${perl:Depends}
#            creates the dependency on the right perl package (i mean the
#            interpreter perl, not some modules) and ${misc:Depends} stays empty
#            atm, but it's there because it could be of use in the future)
# 12:22 <HE> No, you don't need to know if a prereq has xs in it.
# 12:23 <HE> Once again: If you have XS in the Module you want to build,
#            everything belongs to Build-Depends. If it doesn't have XS,
#            everything has to go to Build-Depends-Indep, only debhelper stays in
#            Build-Depends.

[16:45] 	<HE>	Pong.
[16:47] 	<kane-xs>	hey, did you manage to take a look at the tarball?
[16:47] 	<kane-xs>	(also, afk for a min or 2)
[16:49] 	<HE>	Hm? Which tarball?
[16:49] 	<HE>	Ah, that tarball. Sorry, somehow i missed those lines.
[16:49] 	<kane-xs>	p4.elixus.org/snap
[16:49] 	<kane-xs>	there's a -devel tarball of cpanplus
[16:49] 	<kane-xs>	which has cpanplus::dist::deb in it
[17:07] 	<kane-xs>	ehm, found it?
[17:07] 	---	[HE] is away (Gone)
[17:14] 	<HE>	Yes, sorry. My mother asked for my help :)
[17:14] 	<kane-xs>	on perl coding? ;)
[17:15] 	<HE>	No, she hasn't done that in the last few weeks.
[17:15] 	<HE>	[But it happened, my mother is sysadmin at the local university]
[17:15] 	<kane-xs>	heh... and here i think i was being clever ;)
[17:15] 	<HE>	:-)
[17:16] 	<kane-xs>	the deb code is getting slighly out of hand, so i'd like the sanity check :)
[17:17] 	<HE>	Looking at it now.
[17:20] 	<HE>	Well, the code for the description is a bit short atm...
[17:20] 	<HE>	Errr.
[17:20] 	<HE>	OK, reworded: The code for the description creates a very short one atm.
[17:20] 	<HE>	There should be at least one paragraph after that (it's the one and only multi-line-field)
[17:21] 	<kane-xs>	ok.. where do you suggest i get it from? :)
[17:21] 	<HE>	dh-make-perl searches the module source for README files and/or =head1 DESCRIPTION parts in the modules.
[17:22] 	<HE>	Oh, and a "This module was autogenerated by CPANPLUS" would be nice too.
[17:22] 	<HE>	The whole license stuff has to be changed. Debian is pretty anal about licenses :-)
[17:23] 	<kane-xs>	yeah, but i don't care all that much about it ;) what's a good way of probing this?
[17:24] 	<HE>	Once again, grepping README files for common phrases.
[17:24] 	<kane-xs>	hmm... there's often a =head1 LICENSE too...
[17:25] 	<kane-xs>	but still.. heuristics :(
[17:25] 	<HE>	Yes, but a script can't do more than that.
[17:25] 	<kane-xs>	true
[17:25] 	<HE>	Oh. Big problem: Where do you create the debian/rules file?
[17:25] 	*	kane-xs checks
[17:26] 	<kane-xs>	eh, i don't :)
[17:27] 	<HE>	Yeah, looked like that.
[17:27] 	*	kane-xs mixed up 'control' and 'rules' apparently
[17:28] 	<kane-xs>	let me see if i can figure out what rules should do? i'm so annoyed i lost most of our previous conversations ;(
[17:29] 	<HE>	rules is the Makefile used to create the deb.
[17:31] 	<kane-xs>	is the rules file also packed with the .deb?
[17:33] 	<HE>	No, it's only used to create them.
[17:33] 	<kane-xs>	hmm, then show me the one you used for the cpanplus one?
[17:34] 	<HE>	http://marcbrockschmidt.de/tmp/rules
[17:35] 	<kane-xs>	oh right.. /that one/
[17:36] 	<kane-xs>	that one looks trickier than the stuff we're generating so far
[17:38] 	<kane-xs>	and i know you told me there were parts that were always there, and ones that were dynamic
[17:39] 	<kane-xs>	but maybe it's more efficient for me to make -devel work on debian properly, and ask you to look at cpanplus::dist::deb and help me finish it
[17:43] 	<HE>	The rules is pretty static.
[17:43] 	<HE>	The only dynamic parts should be the dh_installdocs and dh_installchangelog lines.
[17:44] 	<kane-xs>	hmm.. those are tricky
[17:44] 	<kane-xs>	-f README and install it
[17:44] 	<kane-xs>	and -f CHANGES || ChangeLog and install it?
[17:44] 	<kane-xs>	that seems like a good enough approximation
[17:45] 	<HE>	Yes, something like that should work.
[17:45] 	<kane-xs>	    install --mode=777 -d $(TMP)/var/cache/cpanplus
[17:45] 	<kane-xs>	is that important?
[17:45] 	<kane-xs>	ie, the 'cpanplus' part -- can that just be any name?
[17:46] 	<HE>	It's only needed for the CPANPLUS module, just remove it.
[17:46] 	<kane-xs>	ok... other moduels don't need something like that?
[17:48] 	<HE>	No, other modules don't.
[17:48] 	<kane-xs>	that seems like good news
[17:50] 	<kane-xs>	so i create the rules just before i run dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us
[17:50] 	<kane-xs>	and then all should be well?
[17:50] 	<HE>	Yes.
[17:50] 	<kane-xs>	see any logic missing in the deb.pm bit?
[17:50] 	<HE>	Not at the moment, but i haven't run it.
[17:51] 	<kane-xs>	yeah, i need to fix the makefile.pl to work nicely, then you can install the devel version and try it
[17:51] 	<kane-xs>	and then dpkg -i the .deb, and that's it?
[17:51] 	<HE>	Yes.
[17:52] 	<kane-xs>	ok, then i'll try and add that... i have a virtualpc installed with debian, so i should be able to try this out
[17:53] 	<HE>	OK :)
